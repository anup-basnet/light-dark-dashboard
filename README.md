## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS
- Gulp

### What I learned

I learned how to toggle between light / dark themes using prefers-color-scheme which utilizes the color mode of your OS settings. And I became more familiar with styling the page using Flexbox and Grid behaviors.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
